# Pytest Tester

This is a simple project used to demonstrate and practice the use of Pytest, the Python testing framework. The project contains a set of functions that perform simple mathematical operations, and the goal is to write tests for these functions using Pytest.

## Lesson Plan

For a refresher on Pytest and how it works, you can refer back to the lesson plan, which can be found on the class website here: https://wtcsc.notion.site/Introduction-to-Test-Automation-1b45bd8ee60e4c5aa6c5635fdcd09e69

## Acceptance Criteria

To demonstrate that you have successfully completed this project, you must meet the following criteria:

1. You must have written at least one test in the `test_math_it_up.py` file for each of the functions in the `math_it_up.py` file.
2. You must take advantage of parametrization in your tests to test multiple inputs for each function (e.g., testing both positive and negative numbers). See the lesson plan or the [Pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/parametrize.html) for more information on how to do this.
3. You must have run the tests using the Pytest framework and ensured that they all pass.
4. You must not have modified the `math_it_up.py` file in any way.

## Submission

Upon submission, share the link to your assignment repository on GitHub with one of your classmates and ask them to review your code. This will help you get feedback on your work and improve your skills as a developer, and will be a recurring part of the course moving forward.
